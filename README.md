## This was an exercise provided by Groundfloor for front-end developers. I chose to create a search form with an auto-complete filter for site search and navigation. The search bar filters businesses by name. Clicking on the business sets the lat and lng to state which is then provided by props to the reverse geocoder from the Google Maps API. This updates the map and provides the business name and address as a clickable link that could send you to a business page or view that could be extended to perhaps provide complete business information. I also threw in a search by state function which could be extended or altered to city search, business type, open/closed, or whatever available data provided by the data object.

### Requested feedback

"Finally I would love your feedback on this part of the process. As you are going through the exercise please consider some of the following things:"

* Was it too hard or too easy?
The exercise was of low to moderate complexity. Having limited exposure to search functionality, it was fairly enjoyable to build a functional serach bar that can execute view changes or link functionality. Bringing in a 3rd party API for mapping functionality was fun.

* Was it too much work?
I think the exercise was at a fair level of work. It didn't take too much time to build out and probably wouldn't take too much to extend the exercise as well.

* Did you get a sense of how we work? 
The exercise sugests that funcionality is a large part of what is required from the front end developers at Groundfloor, which makes sense even without having to do the exercise.

* Was there enough opportunity for you to show your stuff?
I feel that the exercise having a fairly open format is a nice chance to play around and set things up however you like. I enjoy React and had typically utilized Express or Rails, so using a Node http local server was a great chance to try something different. Utilizing axios to call the server to consume the given endpoint turned out to be fairly easy in this context and will be something I maynutilize for personal projects going forward. Overall, this was a good opportunity to show a little bit of what I have going on from a development perspective.
